                Founded in 2020, Zingvel was born from a simple idea: travel should be more than just visiting placesâ€”it should be about creating meaningful experiences and connections.
              </Typography>
              <Typography paragraph>
                Our founder, Rahul Sharma, had spent years traveling the world and noticed a gap in the market. While there were plenty of travel booking platforms, none truly focused on curating unique, authentic experiences that would create lasting memories.
              </Typography>
              <Typography paragraph>
                Starting with just a small team of passionate travelers, Zingvel has grown into a platform that connects travelers with carefully selected experiences across the globe. We work directly with local partners to ensure that our customers get the most authentic and enriching travel experiences possible.
